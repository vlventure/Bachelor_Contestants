# Bachelor_Contestants
A look in to the success of bachelor and bachelorette contestants.
In this project, I used the bachelorette dataset provided by fivethirtyeigth to answer questions about the success of contestants on the tv shows the Bachelor and the Bachelorette.  
The packages used in this project are pandas for data cleaning and seaborn for data visualization.   
I answer the following questions:  
1. How many people are eliminated on weeks when they have dates?  
2. How many people are eliminated on weeks when they do not have dates?  
3. How many 1-1 dates do winners go on?  
4. How many group dates do winners go on?  
5. How far does the contestant with the first 1-1 get?  
6. How many winners had the first impression rose?  
7. How far did the first impression rose get?  
8. How many first impression roses also had the first date?  
9. Variables  
10. SHOW: string. Denotes whether the show was Bachelorette or Bachelor. 
11. SEASON: int. The season number. Bachelor and Bachelorette seasons are numbered separately.  
12. ELIMINATION: string. These columns contain information about whether or not a contestant got a rose on a certain week. An 'R' in the row indicates a contestant got a rose and moved on to the next week. 'R1' in the first week indictes that contestant recieved the 'first impression' rose.  
13. DATES: string. These columns contain information about whether or not a contestant had a dat on a certain week. The columns contain strings of the form 'D#' where the number indicates the number of people on the date. So, 'D1' means it was a one-on-one date.
