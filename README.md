# Bachelor_Contestants
A look in to the success of bachelor and bachelorette contestants.
In this project, I used the bachelorette dataset provided by fivethirtyeigth to answer questions about the success of contestants on the tv shows the Bachelor and the Bachelorette. 
The packages used in this project are pandas for data cleaning and seaborn for data visualization. 
I answer the following questions:
How many people are eliminated on weeks when they have dates?
How many people are eliminated on weeks when they do not have dates?
How many 1-1 dates do winners go on?
How many group dates do winners go on?
How far does the contestant with the first 1-1 get?
How many winners had the first impression rose?
How far did the first impression rose get?
How many first impression roses also had the first date?
